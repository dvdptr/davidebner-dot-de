        David Ebner (DE), born 1988 in Trier, is a sound and installation artist
        based in Berlin. He studied Intermedia Design at Trier University of
        Applied Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Gunnar Schmidt.
        Ebner took part in international exhibitions in Carlow, Krakow and
        Paris. His body of work comprises sound sculptures, objects and
        installation in public space. Ebner focuses on the aesthetics of working
        materials such as wood, concrete, lead, and gelatin. Sound is often used
        as an immaterial augmentation to breathe life into the static objects
        and to add a wider spatial dimension.
